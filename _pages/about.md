I am currently a Master’s student in Computer Science and Technology at [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) and work with [Prof. Jitao Sang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9129/). I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Hebei University of Technology](https://www.hebut.edu.cn/).

🔥<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am preparing my PhD applications and am actively seeking a summer research internship to enrich my research experience and secure a strong letter of recommendation. If my research aligns with your projects or if you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out via email!😁</span>🔥

## Research

I participated in the MLLMs-based AI Agent system project, Mobile Agent V2, which aims to develop a multi-agent system for mobile tasks automation. In this project, multiple agents—including a planning agent, a decision-making agent, and a reflection agent—work collaboratively to automate mobile tasks. Additionally, I was involved in the AMBER project, a hallucination study for MLLMs(multimodal large language models), focusing on hallucinations in both discriminative and generative tasks.

Recently, I have developed a strong interest in designing efficient LLMs-based and MLLMs-based agents, as well as exploring human-agent interaction. I am currently investigating ways to enhance agent decision-making capabilities through supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms. My current research interests include:

> - Human-centered AI
> - Human-in-the-loop Agent
> - Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
> - Intelligent Decision-making
